<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing Steam Turbine</li><li>Non-Condensing Steam Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The steam turbine market is primarily divided into condensing and non-condensing types. Condensing steam turbines are designed to maximize efficiency by converting exhaust steam into water, utilizing low-pressure steam, and are commonly used in power generation. Non-condensing steam turbines, on the other hand, discharge exhausted steam directly into a process or heating system, making them suitable for applications where waste heat recovery is essential. These two types cater to different industrial needs and operational efficiencies in energy generation and utilization.</p></p>
