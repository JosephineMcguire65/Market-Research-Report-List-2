<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hyperkalemia Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Patiromer</li><li>Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hyperkalemia treatment market includes key medications like Patiromer and Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate. Patiromer is a potassium binder that helps to reduce elevated potassium levels in the body by exchanging potassium for calcium in the gut. Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate, also a potassium binder, works by trapping potassium ions in its structure, thus promoting their excretion through feces. Both treatments are crucial for managing hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with kidney dysfunction or those on certain medications affecting potassium levels.</p></p>
